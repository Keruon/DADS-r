# DADSÃ¤r
DADSR module with CV control
----------------
Initial design

-Is initial delay really useful vs extra components and board space needed?
-cv per parameter
--control for envelope lenghts doable?
-555 based?
--rising and falling ramp relatively easy
--needs to reverse the direction? roland-y pads use rising ramp sustain
